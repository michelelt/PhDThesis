\summary%\sommario

This is where you write your abstract \dots\ (Maximum 4000 characters, i.e. maximum two pages in normal sized font, typeset with the thesis layout).

The abstract environment is also available, but  \texttt{\string\summary} is preferred because it generates an un-numbered chapter. The abstract environment is more suitable for articles and two column typesetting without a separate title page.

\emptypage %  it works even without the classica option
\acknowledgements% or \ringraziamenti

And I would like to acknowledge \dots

Acknowledgements are mandatory only when people outside the academic institution supported the development of the research that was performed in order to reach the conclusion of the doctorate program.

\begin{dedication}

\textit{I would like to dedicate this thesis to my loving parents} 

{\normalsize 
The dedication very seldom is a proper thing to do; in some countries it is very common, while in other countries it is done for imitation of other people habits. 

The sentence used above clearly is an example of something very common, but it is  useless. Of course we all love our beloved parents, but it is not necessary to ``engrave it in stone''.
